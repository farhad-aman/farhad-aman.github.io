## Research Assistant (NLP Lab), Amirkabir University of Technology  

**Sep 2023 - Present**  
I contributed to optimizing transformer models for reduced energy consumption under Professor [Momtazi's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZA9rRWAAAAAJ&hl=en) supervision. My research focuses on improving the energy efficiency of NLP models by developing techniques that balance computational complexity and resource use, making transformers more sustainable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## Research and Development, Snapp  

**Apr 2022 - Present**  
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Optimization: At Snapp, the leading ride-hailing platform in Iran, I work under [Sadegh Etemad's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZA9rRWAAAAAJ&hl=en) supervision to improve the accuracy of the estimated time of arrival (ETA) predictions. Using advanced machine learning models, including XGBoost, neural networks, and routing engines, my role focuses on developing and deploying models with MLOps tools and software solutions to enhance real-time ETA predictions, contributing to more efficient and reliable operations at scale.  
**Skills**: Machine Learning (TensorFlow, XGBoost, Neural Networks), Routing Engines (OSRM, Valhalla, Graph Hopper), MLOps and DataOps Tools (ML-Flow, Kedro, AirFlow, ONNX), Apache Spark, Apache Kafka
