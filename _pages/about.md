Hello! I'm Farhad, a Computer Engineering student at [Amirkabir University of Technology(AUT)](https://aut.ac.ir/en).
I'm currently working on my thesis, "Energy-Aware Transformers", in Professor Momtazi's lab, focusing on optimizing transformer models for energy efficiency. Additionally, I am involved in research and development at Snapp, under the supervision of Dr. Etemad, where we are working on optimizing the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Snapp's services.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like more information or have any questions!
