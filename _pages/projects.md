## Projects

- [**ANN Using Numpy (Spring 2023)**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/ANN-computational-intelligence-spring2023)  
  Implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture from scratch using only Numpy, focusing on foundational machine learning techniques.

- [**Genetic Algorithm Using Numpy (Spring 2023)**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/genetic-computational-intelligence-spring2023)  
  Implemented a Genetic Algorithm from scratch using Numpy, focused on solving optimization problems.

- [**Pacman AI**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/pacman-AI)  
  Developed an AI agent to play Pacman using various approaches such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), Bayesian Networks, Adversarial Search, and other search algorithms.

- [**XV6 RISC-V**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/xv6-riscv)  
  Extended the XV6 operating system on the RISC-V architecture by implementing a new scheduler and adding support for multithreading.

- **Nostradamus (ETA Prediction Model)**  
  Developed a machine learning model to predict the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) using advanced techniques such as Transformers, XGBoost, neural networks, and routing engines.

- [**JRoyale**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/jroyale)  
  JRoyale is a **Clash Royale** clone developed in Java using the **JavaFX framework**. It is a freemium real-time strategy game combining elements of collectible card games, tower defense, and battle arena mechanics.

- [**HTTP Monitoring System**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/http-monitoring-system-cloud-computing-fall2023)  
  Built a cloud-based system to monitor websites and notify users of performance issues using microservice architecture.

- [**Image Authenticator**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/image-authenticator-cloud-computing-fall2023)  
  Utilizes well-known APIs to detect faces in images and calculates the similarity between faces for authentication purposes.

- [**Fuzzy Self-Driving Car**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/fuzzy-self-driving-car-computational-intelligence-spring2023)  
  Created a self-driving car simulation using fuzzy logic to handle control systems and driving behavior.

- [**Pong Arduino**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/pong-arduino)  
  Developed a Pong game using Arduino, implementing game logic and real-time controls.

- [**Mafia**](https://github.com/farhad-aman/mafia)  
  Created an interactive multiplayer Mafia game with networking and role-based gameplay mechanics.
